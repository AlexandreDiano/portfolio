  "presentation": "<b>Hello! <br /></b> I'm a <b>Developer</b> focused in web apps. I love innovations, to create new things and <b>help the whole world.</b> I really like technology and <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>, I wish to work around these skills, to collaborate with the scientific community and find out new and incredible things.",
  "aboutMe": " I always loved technology but it wasn’t until 2018 that I started programming when I got in a SENAI’s system development course and found it quite interesting. I've concluded it by 2019 and then started  <b>Physics Bachelor graduation in UFPR.</b> I always liked STEM, but I came to realize my true love for codding at the first semester, and after that, I changed my graduation for  <b>System Analysis and Development</b> (also at UFPR), even though my love for physics still lives on and for that, I still want to keep in touch with this part of science. Meanwhile, until I finish my current graduation, my focus isn’t on physics, but I keep my eyes on it so I can stay up to date with the development of the area.  <b>I really enjoy Web Development</b>, but recently I've started studying about IoT and I've grown taste for it. <br /> <br /> <p> Ops, before I forget, I also got a taste about Design and currently i'm learning more and more about this awesome area. </p> <br /> <p> That's what I have to say for now, and if you have any doubt you can call me... Hope we'll be in touch soon </p>",
